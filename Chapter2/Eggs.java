Program Name: Eggs 
Assignment:
Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 
for a dozen eggs or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. 

Write a program that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then 
display the amount owed with a full explanation. 

For example, typical output might be You ordered 27 eggs. 
Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85. 

Save the program as Eggs.java.
